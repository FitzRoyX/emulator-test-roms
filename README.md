This repo is a collection of emulator test roms that have been denested and renamed to the following standard:<br>
<br>
--filename = repo filepath<br>
--start with the author's name<br>
--separate with ^<br>
--convert to lowercase<br>
--optional notes at the end in ()<br>
--if a test rom is only supposed to pass on gbc or wsc variant, change extension to that<br>
--mark with (!) if failing in ares<br>
<br>
Tests that are not pass/fail but require manual comparison to a real system are left out for now. If an author had a license, it is included here.<br>
